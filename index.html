      <p class="card-three">Our packages are not only delicious, but convenient. Students who are new to the vegan life, or who have been a part of this lifestyle but can’t keep up with market prices, will benefit from our services. We offer locally made fruits and vegetables. These packages are ready–made with a 2 day delivery, no shipping fee. We also offer seasonal packages, designed to fit every holiday! There is also a Build–it–yourself section for students who are particular about what types of fruits and vegetables they enjoy, as well as for students who have allergies.  There are also plans available for students who would rather have their packages delivered weekly on a specific day. Inside each package is a new excercise routine for both the mind and body!</p>
